It seems like previous oracle partners are also having the same issue. Most every first 5 messages is fine, then suddenly some people seem to start saying \"I'm sorry it's bugging out on me\"  or \"the hit isn't working properly\" enough for them to give further directions.I feel really bad for this partner since we were trying really hard but chrome just wasn't handling it even with a decent computer build.
